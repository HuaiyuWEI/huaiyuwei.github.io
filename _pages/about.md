I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the UCLA Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, working with Andrew Stewart. My research primarily focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques and satellite measurements to predict the Ocean Meridional Overturning Circulation. Besides, I have also been exploring the mechanisms of eddy-driven topostrophy near sloping seafloors.

Prior to joining UCLA, I got my Ph.D. from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology under the guidance of Yan Wang. My doctoral research focused on the parameterization of mesoscale eddies over sloping seafloors. We developed "slope-aware" paramterizations for both eddy advection and eddy diffusion based on idealized numerical simulations, some of which have been implemented into MITgcm.
