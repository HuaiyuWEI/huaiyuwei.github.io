I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the UCLA Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, working with Andrew Stewart.  I am interested in a wide range of topics in geophysical fluid dynamics, including mesoscale eddies, overturning circulations, and the dynamic impacts of large scale topography in the ocean. My current research primarily focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques and satellite measurements to predict the Ocean Meridional Overturning Circulation. I have also been exploring the mechanisms of eddy-driven topostrophy near sloping seafloors.

Before joining UCLA, I completed my Ph.D. at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology under the guidance of Yan Wang. My doctoral research focused on the parameterization of mesoscale eddies over sloping seafloors. We developed parameterizations of eddy advection and eddy diffusion across continental slopes using idealized numerical simulations, and some of these parameterizations have been implemented into MITgcm.
