I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the UCLA Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, working with Andrew Stewart. My interests span geophysical fluid dynamics, including mesoscale eddies, overturning circulations, and the dynamic impacts of large‚Äêscale topography in the ocean. Before joining UCLA, I completed my Ph.D. at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology under the guidance of Yan Wang.

*My doctoral research focused on parameterizing mesoscale eddies over sloping seafloors across both prograde (left video) and retrograde fronts (right video). We developed slope-aware schemes for both eddy advection and eddy diffusion, and some of these parameterizations have been implemented in MITgcm.*

*Eddy diffusion is suppressed in the upper open ocean, where alongshore flows strengthen, and enhanced at depth, where alongshore flows weaken. Steep topography ‚Äúsqueezes‚Äù eddy, making them highly anisotropic and inefficient in stirring tracers cross-shore.*

*Existing eddy parameterizations cannot constrain eddy buoyancy fluxes across continental slopes. We proposed a slope‚Äêaware GEOMETRIC scaling that incorporates topographic suppression effects via analytical functions of the slope Burger number.*

### üîÅ Reconstructing the Ocean Meridional Overturning Circulation Using Machine Learning

![Dual‚Äêbranch neural network architecture for MOC reconstruction](images/DBNN.png)

*We developed a dual‚Äêbranch neural network that uses satellite‚Äêmeasurable quantities, such as ocean bottom pressure, sea surface height, and wind stress, to reconstruct the oceanic meridional overturning circulation (MOC).*

### ‚ôÜ Formation of Abyssal Prograde Flows and Their Impact on Global Overturning Circulation

![Idealized simulation of abyssal prograde flows](images/Neptune_model.png)

*Observations and simulations have revealed ubiquitous prograde mean flows (currents aligned with the direction of topographic Rossby wave propagation along isobaths) over sloping topography in the abyssal ocean. Using idealized simulations, we show that prograde flows are driven by eddy momentum fluxes resulting from mesoscale eddy stirring of potential vorticity gradients induced by the sloping seafloor.*

### ‚ôÜ Influence of Abyssal Prograde Flows on Slope‚ÄêAdjacent Upwelling

![Schematic of slope-adjacent upwelling in the abyssal overturning circulation](images/Neptune_Upwelling.png)

*The modern view of the return pathway for the abyssal overturning circulation suggests that dense water rises primarily through diapycnal upwelling within thin bottom boundary layers along sloping ocean boundaries. We are investigating how mesoscale eddies and prograde flows influence this slope‚Äêadjacent upwelling paradigm.*
